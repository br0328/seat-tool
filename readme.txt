Building a MacOS Executable file?

1. Make sure you have `Pyinstaller` installed.
To install this module, run the following command in terminal.

pip install pyinstaller

2. Open terminal and move to the project dir, i.e. `seat-tool`.

3. Run the following command.

pyinstaller app.spec

4. If the console asks you something, type `y` and press Enter.

5. The final executable file is `dist/app`.

Thank you!
